# Development

**Week 11/16 - 11/22**  
- Worked on fixing our project goals in order to include more detailed information about how we would calculate weights in our graph
- Began working on adding the classes needed and structure for the visual output of the busiest airports by degree centrality

**Week 11/23 - 11/29**  
*Thanksgiving Break*
- Continued working on calculating the busiest airports by route and then figuring out the logistics of displaying it onto a world map.


**Week 11/30 - 12/6**  
- Completed visual representation of the busiest aiport graph using given data. 
- Started and completed on working on a BFS traversal of the graph of the flight routes data.
- Began creating the landmarkpath class that finds the shortest path from point a to b through c. First implemented methods that got the shortest path between 2 points

**Week 12/7 - 12/11**  
- Cleaned up code and added command line arguments to allow for better usage of our different functionalities
- Created small test cases need for the landmarkpath class and the bfs class
- Worked on our result and readme write ups to finish up the project and make it presentable
